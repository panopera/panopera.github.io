		<h2>What is Personal Information and Why Do We Collect It?</h2>
		<p>“Personal Information” is information or an opinion that identifies you as an individual. We collect and store your email when you sign up for our newsletter, or when you specifically allow our games to collect your email. If you contact us directly for any reason, we may also keep a copy of that correspondence. Your email is collected only to keep you informed of new Panopera Games products and changes to our existing products.</p>

		<h2>Sensitive Information</h2>
		<p>Sensitive information, as defined in the US Privacy Act (1974), includes details such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, professional body memberships, criminal records, or health information. Panopera Games will not attempt to obtain or record any sensitive information.</p>
