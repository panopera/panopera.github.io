			<p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
			<p>At Panopera Games, we value your comments, suggestions and feedback. Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and disclose &#8220;personal information&#8221; and other “non personal information” we have gathered about you.</p>
			<p><b>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it from you?</b></p>
			<p>‘Personal Information’ is information or an opinion that identifies you as an individual.

Your email is collected only to keep you informed of new Panopera Games products and changes to our existing products.</p>
			<p><b>Newsletter</b></p>
			<p>When you elect to join our mailing list for the purpose of receiving our newsletter we may use that “personal information” to provide you with direct marketing communications about upcoming games, features of our websites and other events and promotions related to our products. You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time. All you need to do is unsubscribe from the link in the letter, or let us know in writing that you want to be removed.</p>
			<p><b>Sensitive Information</b></p>
			<p>Sensitive information is defined in the US Privacy Act (1974) to include information or opinion about such things as an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional body, criminal records or health information.</p>
